##W8 D2 

Today we took a great big step. I deployed an app to Heroku and it was awesome. It took barely any time and then within a few minutes I was able to go online and take a look at the new website. I was more than a little impressed. The steps were in themselves a little arcane and there was a little bit of set up but it was worth it in the end. 

The first step that we had to take was to switch out the standard SQLite3 database that was packaged with Rails with postgres, which I had heard to be a real pain but turned out to be rather smooth for me. It required me to download and set up the Postgres app and then editing the Database.yaml file to fit the right criteria. The main problem I found to be the case was how my Textmate worked. The weird indenting had caused Rails to go crazy and it was only after some Google-fu that I found that the number of spaces actually affected how the creation of the PG database turned out to be. 

I am very impressed by so many of the final projects that I have seen around here. Patrick is doing a Javascript thing where you drag and drop different models in order to create a number of todo lists. It was pretty impressive especially it was built with the new Hotness, Backbone. I had to make myself use Backbone. Patrick seems to have done it naturally and it looks great. CJ is building a product that seems to be a legitimate money maker. It uses the open source REPL stuff in order to go and create a cool looking screening tool for interviewees. Even without Bootstrap, it looks great and I am pretty impressed. I look forward to buying stock in it when it goes IPO. 

PerfectPerusals is going along at a very good pace. I am happy to see that in a single day so many features got implemented. I overrode the to_json function in Rails so that we would not be sending down so much data. I also spoke to Aaron and got a lot of confirmation in terms of how the data model is working. I was unsure that a join model Tagging would be the most ideal way to go about creating the Bookshelves but Aaron agreed that it made the most sense. With that information set, I was able to go about and create that familiar table, where you can see all the books in your individual "shelves" with a single click and unlike with the original GoodReads, it can be done in a single query and can be fiddled with.

The next thing that I wanted to do was to implement search, which I had anticipated to take the entire day. In fact, it only took 10 minutes. Paul had suggested that we use ElasticSearch, which brought chills to my surgically repaired heart. I read the documentation and was about to go and take the long journey into the land of ES. However then I overheard this thing called Solr, which seemed to me something that was a lot simpler. I was very satisified to see that Solr actually worked and I was able to search through my (tiny) database of books. 

Still so much to do but the progress was tangible. Until next time ...

Next Steps to Implement: 
* Moving books around between shelves (might need to modify the to_json side considering how actually different the models are between the front and the back ends)
* Moving books around and between shelves within the All Books page 
* Friend and social stuff if I can with recommendations
