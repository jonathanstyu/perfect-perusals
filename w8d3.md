There was a lot to talk about today with regards of what was done. At the end of the day yesterday my goal was to go and complete the tagging functionality for PerfectPerusals. I wanted to be able to go and tag books and add them to a set number of shelves. (Later on I would figure that I could then add the capacity to create new features and such.) I had thought that this functionality would be exceptionally difficult. The biggest challenge of yesterday was to mentally tally and assemble the mental model necessary. Let me explain with a big long story. 

I had made a design choice to represent "bookshelves" as actually join models between a separate user model and a separate book show object. This join model would have a name of its own and that would be the label of the book shelf. The reason I chose is that is that so someone can click on "All Books" and then suddenly see all the books that they have on all of their shelves. The challenge with this is that the Tagging model does not have all that much information all by itself and the result is that you have this situation where if you want to get information about all of your books then you would have to push down from the server not only just the Tagging model instance by itself but a whole bunch of other data with it as well. So not only the Tagging model but also the Book model that it belongs to. And if you have to have the Book information then you have to have the associated Author's information, which I have locked away as a "User" because I anticipate that some Users might become authors themselves. So you have a nested nested relation where you send down a Tagging ... which includes a Book ... which includes an Author. That's a lot of data that send down and a lot of data to tuck away into the Backbone Collection that I have set up in the system. Some of it is nigh unneeded too! 

The choice I made then was to go override the Book's user TO_JSON methods so that it sends down only the information that is needed. I also then needed to write some methods on the Book Ruby model that it collects some of the information necessary - info that is only available on the server side and would be a waste to send down to the client like the average rating from all the reviews. This information probably was better handled on the server and though I wanted to offload as much processing to the client side, for the sake of speed and such I kept this on the server. 

The consequence of this choice though - and what made me nervous - was that the model on the client and the model on the server are in fact very different. A Tagging in the backend is just three fields. A Tagging on the client side Backbone is a full on system with associated Books and Authors. I was nervous about what would happen if I made some careless Backbone.Syncs or Saves. Would it screw up? Would it create valid information? Would it crash the backend? I ended up being very careful about what was saved and not saved. However as the use of Backbone spread throughout my entire application while staying far short of a one-page application, I found myself being increasingly nervous about the inputs and outputs that I was going to make especially as I was going to start the feature of "Moving a book from 1 shelf to another". 

What turned out to be the case was that the simplicity of the Tagging model was my savior. I only needed to know from the params the name of the new tag. The book and the User terms are never going to change. So I simply turned back the clock on some of my forms knowledge and had the Rails take on only what was in params[:name]. The entire tagging module took some 15 minutes not counting some of the styling that I did to make it look better. For something that I had estimated to take an hour and a half this was not bad. 

The next feature that I wanted to do was to Create a New book. I had been annoyed that I only had 5-6 books that I could work with in our Seeds file. So I wanted to be able to add them even if I was not quite sure where that would fit within the site's overall workflow. Luckily today's lecture was really helpful in getting this accomplished. Ned talked about Paperclip and integrating this thing called Amazon S3 into the system. The main challenge in integrating the cover image into the book model form was twofold. First, in setting up the actual service and getting them to play nice with each other. I found that there was a lot of trouble in getting the S3 bucket to have the right permissions. I also found that there was a lot of pain in getting the Paperclip configs right. It was not pointing to the right endpoint, and it was only after a lot of Googling and explanation that I finally found the right setting. It literally was nothing more than a single underscore. 

The last thing that got done today was to create the Friend feature. It was a simple join model. The interesting thing that I thought was pretty cool that I finally bit the bullet and created a "friend" method on the User model, a model which has been the heart of the entire application. Makes friending an easy thing. 

Features Accomplished: 
* Deleting a book from a book shelf
* Moving a book from one shelf to another
* Creating a new book 
* Creating a new book with an uploaded cover image
* Users can now friend each other 
* Stats Dashboard on the home page with various simple statistics and a mini-table 

Features I want to Implement Tomorrow: 
* Following like Twitter
* Friend Feed
* Friend messages 
* Friend's Book recommendations
* Flesh out the Stats Dashboard as much as I can
